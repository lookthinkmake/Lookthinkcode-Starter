Built from [Hossein Karami's](https://github.com/HosseinKarami) [FastShell](https://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell),
this is a great little starter project using [HTML5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Sass](http://gulpjs.com/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/).


To install, run `npm install` in the root directory.

After node packages finish installation, run `gulp` to start.

Add javascript plugins to src/js/plugins and they will be automatically minified and included in plugins.js.
